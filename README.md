# therm_anomaly_detection

Steps:
(prob need to install pipenv, I don't remember that step off the top of my head)

`pipenv install`

`pipenv shell`

`python -m ipykernel install --user --name=therm_anomaly_detection`

`jupyter notebook`

Once you load the jupyter notebook up, you can toggle the kernel (`Kernel > Change Kernel`) to run using the dependencies installed via pipenv. This only matters if you want to run the code locally. Otherwise, you should be able to view output of the Jupyter notebook.
